## Project 1, Iteration 1

## Project Report
This project was a bit of a challenge for me. I had many issues with GitHub initially becuase I could not get the GitHub Actions and the YML file to work so that set me back. I think this project has given me a good understanding of how the physics in the engine work. Depending on how complex the math is, will ultimately determine how advanced you can make your controls. After a lot of time spent trying to get GitHub up and running, I finally made more progress on the actual playability of the game and I enjoyed looking at all of the different ways you can control the nodes. I found that this project was harder than I anticipated it to be, yet I am eager for the next iteration because I have much more knowledge of the engine itself due to the amount of time I spent working on this project. Even though the game is pretty bare bones, I was focusing soley on meeting the requirements and making the code as simple as possible. I left signals out of this project for the reason that if I had planned for more time, I could have implemented a working start menu, different firing mechanics, and scoring system, but I find that what I have is hopefully sufficient of a B. The one concern I had was for criteria B-4. I know the implementation of the clamp() method is what you were looking for but I simply did not allocate myself enough time to understand how to use it with the way I designed my firing mechanism and I did not want to have to start it over. Overall, I thought this was a pretty reasonably difficult challenge for me, but I think I was able to make the best out of it and I gained a lot of experience with just using GoDot Engine in general which is a big help.
